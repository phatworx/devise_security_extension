    # SessionNonTransferable works along SessionLimited and ensures,
    # session is bound to IP address and User Agent (browser).
    # This means that if someone capture users session id, and tries to
    # access the application from different IP or User agent, session
    # wont work.
    # Be aware that this solution is brittle and some users using broadband
    # that frequestly changes IP addresses (mobile broadband) may encountre
    # spontanious sign-outs
